# Lean Startup in a Week: Project Title

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to apply the principles of the Lean Startup methodology to launch a minimum viable product (MVP) within one week. This project aims to validate a startup idea quickly and efficiently, focusing on continuous learning and iteration. The initial phase includes creating a landing page to gauge user interest and gather feedback. The project will also explore the creation of a web app based on the data obtained from user interactions with the landing page.

## Technologies Used

*   **Frontend:**
    *   React: For building the user interface.
    *   Next.js: For server-side rendering and static site generation.
    *   Tailwind CSS: For utility-first CSS styling.
*   **Backend:**
    *   Node.js: For server-side scripting.
    *   Express.js: For building APIs. (future development)
*   **Database:**
    *   MongoDB: For data storage. (future development)
*   **Other Tools:**
    *   Git: For version control.
    *   GitHub: For project hosting and collaboration.

## Lean Startup Methodology

This project strictly follows the Lean Startup methodology. Key principles include:

1.  **Build-Measure-Learn Loop:** We will quickly build an MVP (landing page), measure user responses, and learn from the data to make informed decisions.
2.  **Validated Learning:** Emphasis on collecting data to validate our hypotheses about user needs and product-market fit.
3.  **Minimum Viable Product (MVP):** The initial landing page serves as the MVP, helping us test our core value proposition.
4.  **Iterative Development:** We will adapt and improve our product based on feedback and metrics.
5.  **Pivot or Persevere:** If our initial idea doesn't gain traction, we will pivot to a new approach.

## Features

*   **Landing Page:**
    *   Redesigned UI with modern components (Shadcn UI, Tailwind).
    *   Dynamic video background in the hero section.
    *   Sections for Features, Activities (More Than Just a Club), Social Proof (Testimonials), and How It Works.
    *   Header navigation links scroll to corresponding page sections.
    *   Added a "Past Events" section showcasing recent activities.
    *   Footer with relevant links.
*   **Activity Exploration (/explore):**
